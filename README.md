}

// Windowed sleep detection (2.5 second window)
bool detectDrowsiness(List<double> earHistory) {
  final threshold = 0.23; // Same as car_ai
  final sleepRatio = earHistory.where((ear) => ear < threshold).length / earHistory.length;
  return sleepRatio > 0.8;
}
```

#### **Head Pose Analysis**
```dart
// 3D head pose estimation for distraction detection
class HeadPose {
  final double pitch;

}
```

#### **Motion Sickness Detection**
```dart
