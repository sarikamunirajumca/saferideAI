# SafeRide AI App - Advanced In-Car Safety Monitoring System

SafeRide AI App is a comprehensive Flutter-based mobile application that transforms your smartphone or tablet into an intelligent in-car safety monitoring system. By integrating advanced computer vision algorithms from our car_ai Python system, this app provides real-time driver and passenger safety monitoring with sophisticated AI-powered detection capabilities.

## üéØ **Purpose**
Transform any vehicle into a smart safety monitoring system by installing a device running SafeRide AI App on the dashboard. The app continuously monitors driver behavior and passenger safety, providing immediate alerts for potentially dangerous situations.

## üöó **In-Car Installation**

- **Windowed Detection**: Analyzes patterns over 2.5-second windows
- **Sleep Ratio Calculation**: Detects when 80% of frames show closed eyes
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable thresholds for different conditions

### **Driver Distraction Monitoring**
- **Head Pose Estimation**: 3D head tracking using facial landmarks
- **Angle Thresholds**: Alerts when head turns beyond 45¬∞ (looking away)
- **Continuous Tracking**: Real-time head position monitoring
- **Multi-axis Analysis**: Pitch, yaw, and roll angle detection

### **Advanced Yawning Detection**
- **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)**: Sophisticated mouth opening analysis
- **Fatigue Correlation**: Links yawning frequency to tiredness levels
- **Temporal Analysis**: Tracks yawning patterns over time
- **Early Warning System**: Detects fatigue before severe drowsiness

### **Motion Sickness Detection**
- **Head Movement Analysis**: Tracks 30-frame history of head positions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates standard deviation of movement
- **Erratic Pattern Detection**: Identifies unusual head movement patterns
- **Passenger Monitoring**: Extends beyond just driver monitoring

### **Priority-Based Alert System**
1. **Sleep/Drowsiness** (Highest Priority - 60s cooldown)
2. **Driver Distraction** (High Priority - 30s cooldown)
3. **Phone Usage** (Medium Priority - experimental)
4. **Smoking Detection** (Medium Priority - experimental)
5. **Seatbelt Monitoring** (Medium Priority)
6. **Yawning/Fatigue** (Lower Priority - 30s cooldown)
7. **Motion Sickness** (Lowest Priority - 30s cooldown)

## üì± **Technical Architecture**

- **On-Device Processing**: All AI computation happens locally
- **Privacy-First**: No data uploaded to external servers
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Immediate processing and alert generation

### **Advanced Algorithms (From car_ai)**
```dart
// Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Calculation
final ear = (leftEyeOpen + rightEyeOpen) / 2.0;

// Windowed Sleep Detection
final sleepRatio = closedEyeFrames / totalFrames;

// Head Pose Analysis
final distraction = abs(headYaw) > 45¬∞ || abs(headPitch) > 45¬∞;

// Motion Sickness Detection
final movementStd = calculateStandardDeviation(headPoseHistory);
```
